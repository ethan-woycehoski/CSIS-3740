# CSIS-3740
This is my first project done in CSIS 3740. It is a digital ALU that does basic arithmetic and logic operations. 

The commented code in main.cpp is mine, along with my report. Everything else was provided by the professor to help us get started. The code tests and successfully allows the user to input a number and display it in the following formats: binary, hexadecimal, unsigned integer, and two's complement signed integer.
