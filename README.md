# CSIS-3740
This is where I will be putting all projects done during the course Computer Organization from Youngstown State University.
During this course I will be learning basic hardware components, structure, and implementation of computer systems.
I will also be learning assembly language and instruction set architecture. 
Combinational and sequential digital logic, CPU and control unit design will also be studied.
